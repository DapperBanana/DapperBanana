  - Creating a text adventure game! (Link to come)
- ⌨ My _ongoing_ project:
  - [Building out a roguelike inside a Discord channel](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Discord-Roguelike)
- 🌱 Right now, I'm learning DevOps. The CI/CD pipeline has continuous upgrades and I strive to keep on top of everything as much as I can.
