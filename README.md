## About me

I'm a tech enthusiast based in Calgary, AB Canada, with a rich background in Electronics Engineering🤖, DevOps👨‍💻, and _most recently_ working in the exciting world of... **Data Analytics!🔢**

- 💼 Business Analyst/Data Analyst/Software Engineer/Infrastructure Analyst/Web Developer and more at [Heartland Generation](https://www.heartlandgeneration.com/)
- 🌱 Currently diving into the intricacies of **Edge Computing and Firmware Development.** I'm passionate about bringing computation closer to the source of data and delving into low-level programming for devices. My journey involves understanding the challenges of distributed systems, reducing latency, and optimizing the efficiency of computing at the edge. As I explore the world of firmware development, I aim to enhance my skills in programming microcontrollers and designing systems that seamlessly interact with hardware.
- ⌨ My _ongoing_ video game projects:
  - [Building out a roguelike inside a Discord channel (_Python_)](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Discord-Roguelike)
  - [Designing my own NES emulator (_6502 ASM_)](https://github.com/DapperBanana/NES-Projects)
  - Creating a multiplayer text-based adventure game (_C#_) (link to come, it's private for now)
- 📚 Ever eager to broaden my expertise. I'm keenly interested in delving into **Software Architecture and Design Patterns,** where I can deepen my understanding of building scalable and maintainable systems. Additionally, exploring **Enterprise-Level Application Integration** and mastering the intricacies of designing solutions that seamlessly integrate with diverse systems is a focal point in my learning journey. Lastly, as always, I aim to enhance my proficiency in translating complex technical concepts into strategic business solutions.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I lived in Mexico for over a year and came out speaking Mandarin, 奇怪！🤷🏼‍♂️
