# Hi there, I'm Austin 👋🏼

I live in Calgary, AB Canada and have worked in Electronics Engineering🤖, DevOps👨‍💻, and _most recently_... **Data Analytics!🔢**

- ⌨ My _ongoing_ video game projects:
  - [Building out a roguelike inside a Discord channel](https://github.com/Captain-Howard/Discord-Roguelike)
  - [Setting up a fun RTS prototype in Godot](https://github.com/DapperBanana/Untitled-RTS)
  - Text Adventure C# game (link to come, it's private for now)
- 🌱 Right now, I'm learning DevOps. The CI/CD pipeline has continuous upgrades and I strive to keep on top of everything as much as I can. Feel free to take a look at some of my [SysAdmin tools](https://github.com/DapperBanana/Local-PC-PoSh-Scripts)
- 📚 I'd love to learn more about **cybersecurity**
- 💬 Ask me about working in tech, career changes, or learning new things!
